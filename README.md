# Final Fantasy XIV

A quick tool written to facilitate relisting items on the market board, undercutting the least expensive items.  Limits can be set such that if another player lists an item at too low a price, it is relisted at a specified default so you won't end up selling something valuable for 1 gil.

Memory offsets are from sometime around 4.2 and are almost assuredly no longer functional.  Cheat Engine can be used to find current offsets, however I have been away from the game for quite some time and there's no guarantee this is even still functional.

The GUID repo name is to make it less searchable as market bots can ruin an economy, but I still wanted the code public.
